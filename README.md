A cross-platform weather app showing current weather at your location
https://expo.io/@dnzsaglam/projects

To run on your local, make sure you have expo (see http://expo.io).
Also, don't forget to provide an OpenWeather.js that exports a const API_KEY
to utilize OpenWeather API.

Then simply type expo start in the terminal and you're ready to go.
